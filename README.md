### Introduction
A flight delay is a serious and a widespread problem in the United States. An increasing flight delay is having a significant impact not just on the US air travel system but also on the cost of airlines and passenger inconvenience costing billions of dollars each year(Ball, et.al, 2010). It is seen that delay increases non-linearly as demand approaches the capacity in the system. Passengers look for reduced travel time while booking a flight. Due to a delay on one occasion, a passenger may refrain from opting that particular airline as a result of discontent(Cook, 2009).

### Goal
The goal of our project is to analyze the dataset from Bureau of Transportation Statistics, develop a visualization aspect which shows the trends and helps minimize delays for future customers. We have considered answering some of the questions below:
-   What are the causes of delays? Eg: Weather, security checks, late aircraft delay, NAS(National Aviation System), carrier?
-   How are each airlines performing in terms of these common factors?
-   In which particular month do flights usually face delay(Holiday, Winter, storm).
-   Which flight is having the least delay?
-   What is the average departure delay by a particular airline?
-   What is the average weather delay by Month and airline?
-   What is the total travel time of airlines?

### Objectives:
Develop a tool in which we can use data insights to minimize delay. Perform Spatio-Temporal analysis using a combination of source/destination airport location and time of the year when looking at weather delays.
Narrow it down to major airports which are face high air traffic and severe weather conditions and certain US airlines. 
We plan to use ‘Power BI’ for visualizing the data and build a dashboard. 

### Anticipated outputs 
This project will include a web-based tool which provides useful insights to minimize your airline delays. We need to combine the datasets from the source to create a functionality where the user can select origin and destination airports. The interactive dashboard provided by the tool gives comprehensive analysis about airport delays.
